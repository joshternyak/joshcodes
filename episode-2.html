          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-4">This is everything I've learned in my web developer journey.</h2>
          <p>Web development is one of the most valuable skills to learn. If you learn how to build stunning websites and applications with HTML, CSS, JS, and more,
            not only will you make lots of money, you will also have a valuable skillset that will enable you to build applications that people will buy and use everyday.
            I started teaching myself web development when I was only 11, here's everything I learned.</p>

          <img src="images/web-development-roadmap.png" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="Web Development Roadmap Illustration">

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">First, identify your goal</h2>
          <p>Before you start diving in to the tutorials, you must identify your goal. Is it to make money? Or is it to get a secure job at a company like Microsoft? Whatever it is, identify your goal and write it down so you can look at it everyday and get it engraved in your mind.</p>
          <p>You can work as a developer at a company, work as a freelancer, create your own business, become a consultant, code for fun, or create an app to make money.</p>
          <p>Once you identify your goal, you should move on to removing all distractions to make sure you use your valuable time wisely.</p>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Get rid of all distractions</h2>
          <p>Distractions are everywhere. On the internet, in your house, and on your phone. It is critical that you remove these time-wasting distractions from your life,
            because if you don't, you probably won't end up where you wanted to be.</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">1. Delete time-wasting apps on your cell phone</h4>
          <p>Whether it's Instagram, or that fun car racing game, whatever it is, delete time-wasting apps from your cell phone so you know you won't be spending
            your valuable time using them. You should also keep your cell phone off or in a separate room from where you're working.</p>
          <p>Email is an important part of work for many people. However, it's also important that you minimize the time you spend on email to create a more focused working environment.</p>
          <p>According to a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-spent-mobile-phone-usage-data">recent study</a>, "the overall time Americans spend on
            various media is expected to grow to nearly 11 hours per day this year, after accounting for declines in time spent with other media like TV and newspapers that are increasingly
            moving online, according to Zenith."</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">2. Create a clean and organized work environment</h4>
          <p>When you work in a messy environment, you feel messy. On the other hand, when you work in a clean and organized environment, you're more likely to be more productive.
            You'll also feel physically better because of the minimized dust.</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">3. Work in a quiet environment</h4>
          <p>Imagine trying to focus in a bar. The loud music and people will distract you and prevent you from being able to focus on your work. The same holds true for your work environment at home.</p>
          <p>If you live by yourself, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you live with family or a roommate, tell them you are working and just kindly ask them to not turn on loud music or television.</p>
          <img src="images/person-coding-desk.jpeg" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="Person coding at desk">

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Don't try to learn everything at once</h2>
          <p>The biggest mistake I've made throughout my web development journey was to try to learn everything at once. When you try to learn everything at once, you end up learning little or even nothing.</p>
          <p>As you're learning, don't jump from tutorial to tutorial. Have the video tutorial or blog tutorial on full screen to help minimize any possible distractions.</p>
          <p>Set a specific amount of time that you'll learn everyday and stick to it. It's better to consistently learn 1 hour everyday than to learn 3 hours on Monday and 10 minutes on
            Thursday, according to <a href="https://leadaz.org/2017/03/27/consistency-yields-effective-learning/">the study</a> by leadaz.org.</p>
          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Choose a platform where you'll learn the most</h2>
          <p>Youtube is a great platform to learn web development. There are countless courses, videos, and quick tutorials. Best of all, it's free.
            Here's a list of some great channels you should definitely watch.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Traversy Media</li>
            <li>CS Dojo</li>
            <li>whatsdev</li>
            <li>Dev Ed</li>
            <li>LearnCode.academy</li>
            <li>freeCodeCamp.org</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">The necessities you need to have</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Computer & OS:</b> MacOS, Windows, Linux</li>
            <li><b>Text Editor / IDE:</b> Sublime Text, VSCode, Visual Studio, Atom</li>
            <li><b>Web Browser:</b> Chrome, Firefox, Safari</li>
            <li><b>Terminal:</b> Bash, Zsh, Git Bash, iTerm</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Learning how to code is like climbing Mt. Everest</h2>
          <p>It's a long journey. Becoming a professional web developer that understands HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, PHP, etc. doesn't happen in a day, week, or month.
            It happens in years full of consistent learning day in and day out.</p>
          <p>Feeling rushed is common, but you must not have that feeling. The ones who truly succeed in web development are those who have grit,
            determination, good habits, and consistent learning and practice.</p>
          <img src="images/mount-everest.jpeg" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="Person climbing a mountain">

          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Front-end web developer tools</h2>
          <p>Some tools you probably will work with as a professional front-end web developer.</p>

            <li>Webpack or Parcel (Javascript Module Bundlers)</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Deploying your website</h2>
          <ol>

            use Git for version control, and deploy and maintain projects.</p>
          <img src="images/productive-person.jpeg" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="productive person">

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Choose a front-end framework</h2>
          <p>Frameworks allow you to build powerful applications with organized and interactive UIs. They speed up your workflow and help make coding more enjoyable.
            Even though they can be hard to learn, it is worth your time and effort to understand them and use them day-to-day.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>React JS</li>
            <li>Vue JS</li>
            <li>Angular JS</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">What a front-end wizard should be able to do</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Be familiar with popular front-end frameworks</li>
            <li>Build advanced front-end apps</li>
            <li>Have smooth front-end workflow</li>
            <li>Interact with data and APIs</li>
            <li>Manage the state of applications</li>
            <li>Server side rendering / static site generation</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Backend: Server-Side Languages (Choose 1)</h2>
          <p>To be a backend or full stack developer, you must learn a server-side programming language.</p>
          <p>Here are a handful of popular server-side languages.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Rust</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>C#</li>
          </ol>
          <img src="images/backend-coding-laptop.jpeg" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="backend coding laptop">

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Backend: Databases</h2>
          <p>Most web applications need a place to store data, whether it's the login info of a user, or how many clothes a customer added to their cart. Here are popular databases you should choose from.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Relational Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL</li>
            <li>Cloud Database: Firebase, AWS</li>
            <li>NoSQL: MongoDB, Rethink DB, CouchDB</li>
            <li>Lightweight: Redis, SQLlite</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Backend: GraphQL</h2>
          <p>GraphQL is a query language for your API that's a single endpoint that  asks for only what you want. With simple syntax that's similar to JSON, GraphQL
            is fairly easy to implement and use. Apollo is a client that interacts with the GraphQL server.</p>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Backend: Deployment</h2>
          <p>As a backend or full-stack developer, you must know how to create and manage environments and deploy your projects to the web.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>SSH</li>
            <li>Web Server Environment</li>
            <li>App Hosting</li>
            <li>Testing</li>
            <li>Load Balancing</li>
            <li>Monitoring</li>
            <li>Security</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Full Stack Web Development</h2>
          <p>At this point, you are a full-stack wizard and can create and deploy powerful web applications. You can also:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Build UIs with a variety of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JS)</li>
            <li>You understand server-side programming and can use a server-side framework</li>
            <li>Setting up dev environments and workflows is easy for you</li>
            <li>You can build backend apps, APIs, and micro services</li>
            <li>Working with databases isn't a hassle for you</li>
            <li>You can deploy an application or website to production (Git, SSH, Cloud, etc)</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Build jaw-dropping projects</h2>
          <p>Now that you understand how the web works and how to build functional applications
            and well-designed websites, you should build your own projects. For example, I once
            built my very own CSS framework, Freeeze CSS. It only took 2 days to built, and helped me understand how CSS
            works at a practical level.</p>
          <p>That's the main reason why you should build your own projects, to understand how a certain programming language or
            technology works at a practical level. To get
            better at Javascript, you could build a cookie clicker game.</p>
          <p>These are very simple and basic projects to build, but they will definitely help you understand
            how programming and web development works.</p>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Make your portfolio (You CAN use a template)</h2>
          <p>After you learned web development and built a handful of jaw-dropping projects, you should showcase your work
            and skills on a portfolio. There are many great examples, one of which being <a href="http://findmatthew.com/">Matthew Williams</a>. He has a
            simple and well-designed portfolio that you can use as an example to build your own.</p>
          <img src="images/matthew-williams-website.png" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="matthew williams website">
          <p>An example of a creative portfolio is by <a href="https://juliangarnier.com/">Julian Garnier</a>. He has a portfolio with an Iphone text message
            design that makes it very unique.</p>
          <img src="images/julian-garnier-website.png" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="julian garnier website">

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">You don't need to get good grades</h2>
          <p>You don't need to have a 4.0 GPA to become a web developer expert. There are many people who didn't like school and
            didn't do well that succeeded in web development. The things you learn in school are not practical in the sense that
            you won't need to know them to succeed in the modern world. Knowing what Romeo did in Act 1, Scene 2 in Romeo & Juliet
            is pointless and won't add any value to your life, so don't even break a sweat worrying about it.</p>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">Web development is very profitable</h2>
          <p>However, teaching yourself web development will add lots of value to your life and people who you will work with.
            It is a very profitable industry full of competitive salaries.</p>
          <p>I'm not a finance expert, but I do know that a common financial mistake humans make is once they get a high-paying job,
            they tend to spend more money. Whether it's buying a new car, or buying a fancier house, they don't realize the long-term
            effects of living over their means.</p>
          <p>This is why you must not spend money on things that won't actually add value to your life.
            A great blog that goes into detail about this subject is <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-3 display-5">My story</h2>
          <p>2018: It was the last day of school. I came home, and my brother welcomed me and said, "Congratulations! Now,
            you'll have so much time on your hands." I replied, "What should I do with it", and he said, "You should teach
            yourself how to code".</p>
          <p>This was the most memorable moment of my life. And so that's what I did. I spent the entire summer watching youtube
            videos and reading articles on the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and everything in between. The first few days were
            exciting and exhausting.</p>
          <p>I remember sitting on my bedroom floor for over 5 hours being extremely confused on how to get rid of default
            margin on the page. After finding the solution, I was the happiest web developer alive. All I had to do was <code class="bg-light p-1 text-dark">body { margin: 0 }</code>
            in the stylesheet. It was on that day that I knew I found my hidden talent and passion.</p>
          <p>I spent the next 2 months applying my skills by building landing pages. But there was one day when
            I didn't feel like coding at all. I was tired of the debugging, the CSS errors, and the images not loading.</p>
          <p>So, I did what I never thought could be possible in the world of web development. I took a BREAK. It was
            the most important choice I had made that taught me an important lesson. To be a successful web developer,
            you must take breaks. What works for me might not work for you, but I usually take a 5 minute break every 1–2 hours.</p>
          <p>2019: After 7 months of learning the basics of web development and building landing pages, I stepped
            into the world of client work. Actually, I took a leap into it, and texted my friends asking them, "Hey,
            can you ask your dad or mom if they need or want a website". Funny enough, it worked. I ended up building
            a portfolio for my friend's dad that showcased his photography. At the end of that project, I learned 3 valuable lessons.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Before you begin working on a project, plan everything you will need and do.</li>
            <li>Constant client communication is critical if you want to build trust.</li>
            <li>To prevent future headaches, know how to do what is necessary to get the job done.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>After this project, I decided to build my portfolio. At first, it didn't look that nice, and so I
            decided to use a free HTML theme to save time building it. After it was nice and filled with my projects,
            I focused the next two months on learning backend programming. This included the basics of python and web
            development with flask. It was a challenging process, but in the end, I had managed to successfully build
            twitter replica called "BlogItPoints". However, it taught me a lot about how the web works, and was also a fun experience.</p>
          <p>At this point in my web developer life, I finally reached a level of satisfaction. I understood how much work I
            put into reaching my goal, and in fact reached that goal. I taught myself the basics of code, how to build websites,
            and how to find people to build them for. This is when I decided to build my own CSS framework from scratch. I planned
            everything I would do, and I estimated that it would take me around 2 weeks to build. It ended up taking me only two 2
            days. This brings me to another lesson I've learned:</p>
          <p class="border-dark border-left pl-3">It's better to overestimate how long it will take you to complete a project and finish it earlier
            than expected, rather than underestimating how long it will take, and not meeting the deadline.</p>
          <p>2020: When I came back home, I was ready to build a product that would save developers and designers hundreds
            of hours of time so they can focus on building web products that make the world a better place. And so that's
            what I did. I spent 113 long hours building <a href="http://www.loveyourlanding.com/">LoveYourLanding</a> full of blood, sweat, and tears (I got a paper cut).</p>
          <img src="images/loveyourlanding.png" class="w-100 mb-4 mt-2" alt="loveyourlanding html website theme">
          <p>I hope you feel inspired, motivated, and excited to make your own web development dreams come true. Becoming a
            self-taught web developer is hard, especially when you're young.</p>
          <p>But, if you put in the time, effort, and thinking, then you will achieve what seems impossible,
            especially if you use LoveYourLanding to give you a head start. I'm 15 and taught myself how to
            code and be an independent web developer when I was only 13, so don't make excuses.</p>
          <p>Share this post with anyone you know that needs a little motivation and inspiration. My goal
            is to help and inspire as much people as I possibly can and to make the world of web development
            a more fun, exciting, and better place.</p>
