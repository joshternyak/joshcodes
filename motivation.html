Ever since social media became popular, millions of people have become lazy and unmotivated in their life. This might seem shocking to some people but it is very true. Even though so many people are unmotivated and lazy, there are ways to change your life and how much motivation you have. </p>
            <p class="text-normal center-self blog-text text-left mt-1 mb-1 text-dark">The first way to increase your motivation level is to get rid of social media. Social media is controversial and many people have different opinions on it. The reason why getting rid of all social medias will drastically increase your motivation levels is because of how it changes your brain chemistry. When you constantly do repetitive motions such as scrolling more and more, your brain begins to get adjusted to it. Therefore, your motivation levels to change your life in a positive way will disappear.</p>
            <p class="text-normal center-self blog-text text-left mt-1 mb-1 text-dark">The second way to increase your motivation level is to get rid of negative people. Negative people cause you to be negative, and not happy. Your goal should be to get rid of all of them by not talking to any of them. This will instantly have a big impact on your mood and success in a positive way. Think of the world negative as "no", you want "no" "negative" people in your life. You should only be around positive people who bring you up instead of push you down to a lower level.</p>
            <p class="text-normal center-self blog-text text-left mt-1 mb-1 text-dark">The third way to increase your motivation level is to wake up earlier. Waking up at least an hour earlier has shown to increase productivity and success in anything you do. The reason for this is if you do not have social media, and you don't waste time with negative people, you will have one more hour every day to work on yourself and your life. This habit will have a massive and direct impact towards how successful and motivated you are.</p>
            <p class="text-normal center-self blog-text text-left mt-1 mb-1 text-dark">In conclusion, motivation is not difficult to achieve. To drastically increase your motivation levels, get rid of social media, remove negative people from your life entirely, and wake up earlier every morning. After you do these three important things, you will feel motivated to change the world. <b>Now, go and do it, don't just keep reading!</b>
