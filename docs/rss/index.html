It's very easy to do unproductive things, everyday. However, if you have a time and task management system that you use and implement daily, you will master the skill of productivity.</p><p>This is the ultimate guide to being productive, day-in and day-out, getting more done, accomplishing your goals, staying organized, and more.</p><p>Let's dive right in!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/productivity-roadmap-illustration.png" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><h2 id="remove-daily-distractions-social-media-games-shows-web-surfing-"><strong>Remove daily distractions (social media, games, shows, web surfing)</strong></h2><p>First, you must remove the distractions that interrupt your work and focus on a constant basis. This includes time-wasting apps on your cell phone, video games, shows, and web-surfing.</p><p>Once you uninstall social media and game apps on your cell phone, and block distracting sites on your computer, you'll have more time to work on your goals. Not only that, you'll also be able to have a clear mind with less dopamine from the random apps you always use.</p><p>It's very common to be addicted to social media. It wouldn't be very useful to explain why social media is addicting; however, what you must do is just simply uninstall ALL social media apps from your cell phone. Once you've done that, you should also keep your cell phone on silent mode while you're working.</p><h4 id="what-if-i-need-to-use-my-cell-phone-for-work"><strong>What if I need to use my cell phone for work?</strong></h4><p>In this case, don't keep your phone on silent mode, but still remove the addicting social media apps. This will not only help you focus and get more productive work done, you'll also feel less stressed during your work because you won't receive as many notifications from the different social medias you used before.</p><h2 id="benefits-of-quitting-social-media"><strong>Benefits of Quitting Social Media</strong></h2><p>There are many benefits of quitting social media. Research revealed valid reasons why you should toss aside your social media networks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/social-media.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><p>Our happiness and mood are the most important aspects of our lives we must keep in tune. If you're not productive, you must stop and think, What am I doing wrong?</p><p>One thing you could be doing wrong is using social media way too often. We all know that billions of people are addicted to social media. As of this writing, there are 3.81 billion social media users around the world, representing 49% of the world's total population.</p><p>I was addicted to social media for a year, but then I did something that most teenagers don't do. I deleted all social media. In fact, it was the BEST decision of my life. Getting rid of social media meant that I removed toxic negativity from my life. I had more than a handful of hours back everyday to work on my goals. I also removed the toxic drama from my life. Not only that, but I also gave myself a peaceful mind when I deleted social media.</p><p>A month after I deleted social media, I noticed significantly positive changes in all aspects of my life. I could focus on the task I was doing. I could think about and plan my life and goals. I could be productive day-in and day-out.</p><p>This is why you must throw away social media from your life. If you have a business and need social media, keep it, but don't have social media on your cell phone (You don't need it on your cell phone). Also, you should remove the feed from your social medias because it distracts you from your goal which is to promote your product or business.</p><p>For social comparisons, social media might be making you feel less successful in your career, relationships, and productivity because of how others make their lives seem. When you scroll through social media feeds, you probably see celebrities looking happy and dressed nice, but in reality, celebrities tend to not be the happiest people (for many reasons).</p><p>You're also losing sleep. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html">CDC</a> reported that 35% of Americans don't even get 7 hours of sleep a night. However, when it comes time to actually get ready for bed, people tend to go on their devices that emit blue light that disturbs your sleep. Not only do you lose sleep by using electronics before bed, you also engrave negativity into your mind by scrolling through other people's lives in their feeds.</p><p>In short, there are many reasons why you should definitely remove social media from your life. You'll focus better and for longer periods of time, and you'll also have a peace of mind without any negative feeds that you'll have to scroll through every 5 minutes.</p><h2 id="the-eisenhower-box-productivity-tool"><strong>The Eisenhower Box: Productivity Tool</strong></h2><p>Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States. He had an incredible ability to stay productive for decades. This is why his productivity methods for time and task management have been studied by many people. He's most famous for the Eisenhower Box which is a simple decision-making productivity tool that anyone can implement right now.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/eisenhower-sitting-down.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><p>Eisenhower's time and task management tool is simple. Simply separate your tasks based on four categories.</p><ol><li>Urgent and important (do these tasks immediately).</li><li>Important, but not urgent (schedule these tasks to do later).</li><li>Urgent, but not important (delegate these tasks to someone else).</li><li>Neither urgent nor important (don't do these tasks, eliminate them).</li></ol><p>"What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important." - Dwight Eisenhower</p><p>Separating your urgent and important tasks is a big factor in determining how productive you really are day-to-day</p><h2 id="josh-ternyak-s-productivity-formula"><strong>Josh Ternyak's Productivity Formula</strong></h2><p>Money Made / Hours Worked = Productivity</p><p>For example, if you made $100 and worked 5 hours, it's fair to say that you made $20 every hour you worked. To increase your productivity, simply decrease the amount of hours you work. This can be achieved by removing all distractions, getting in the flow state zone, and working fast and efficiently.</p><p>To work efficiently, know what you'll have to do before you do it. Then allocate a fixed time period, also known as a timebox, where planned activity takes place. This technique helps you work in chunks, focus more, and work more efficiently to get your work done faster.</p><p>A common workplace issue is that workers don't actually work 9–5. Most of the time, people take a long coffee break, and then surf the web for another 1–2 hours. In reality, those who actually work in a focused and effective manner really do achieve the most.</p><p>You also have to have a reason to work hard and efficiently. Is it to make more money? Or is it to start a company? Whatever the reason is, you must work fast and efficiently to get more done in less time.</p><p>Always remember that the <strong>money made / hours worked = productivity.</strong></p><h2 id="setup-and-use-a-todo-list"><strong>Setup and use a todo list</strong></h2><p>Using a todo list is one of the best ways to stay productive. You will know exactly what needs to be done, and won't have to use your brain power to remember future tasks. The day I started using a <a href="https://dynalist.io/">todo list</a>, my life completely changed.</p><p>I started organizing my days, weeks, months, and years! I knew exactly what needed to be done that day, and what my plans are for the rest of the week. <a href="https://dynalist.io/">Dynalist</a> is what I use and have been using ever since I was introduced to a todo list.</p><p>It's a very simple todo list that is "featureful yet simple". You can create folders filled with documents. Dynalist documents are full of bulleted lists that organize your days, weeks, months, and even years. The best part, it's fully customizable. This means that you can write about whatever you want, without Dynalist telling you that you need to have it written a certain way.</p><p>You can also sync other productivity apps with Dynalist to enhance your overall productivity. I'm not affiliated with Dynalist, I just love their product.</p><p>Here's several examples of how you can use Dynalist.</p><h4 id="weekly-calendar-tasks-"><strong>Weekly Calendar (Tasks)</strong></h4><p>For example, in one Dynalist document, I have my entire week planned out of what I need to do. Here's how it would look like in Dynalist.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/dynalist-calendar.png" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><p>On the bottom, I have a template of how my week would usually look like, and then below that, I have a list of all of the weeks this year I've went through. As of this writing, I'm in "Week 18" (2020 is going by fast).</p><h4 id="dynalist-sidebar"><strong>Dynalist Sidebar</strong></h4><p>On the left side of the application, there is a sidebar that can be filled with folders and documents that organize your goals, future tasks, and projects. Here's how my Dynalist sidebar is structured.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/dynalist-sidebar.png" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><p>Since I'm still in school, I have a folder "School" with a document "Classes" filled with the classes I'm taking now. Below that, I have my favorite and most important folder, "Business" with a document "Calendar" inside. The "Calendar" document is where I keep track of my daily and weekly tasks.</p><p>Because I'm a minimalist, I don't use all of Dynalist's features. However, a great example of all the features Dynalist has is shown <a href="https://dynalist.io/features">here</a>.</p><p>Using Dynalist to plan your yearly goals is easy. Simply make a folder called "Goals/Plans" and inside that folder, make new documents each named a certain year in the future. In the image above, you can see how I have it structured. Inside each year, I have a list of the projects I will work on, fitness goals, and reading goals I WILL accomplish that year.</p><p>This brings me to my next piece of productivity advice.</p><h2 id="plan-your-future-by-setting-goals"><strong>Plan Your Future By Setting Goals</strong></h2><p>If you don't plan your future and set your goals, you won't know where you want to be and where you are now. By planning years ahead, you know what you want out of life. It doesn't matter what age you are.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenkotler/2014/10/16/goal-setting-101-one-of-our-best-performance-boosters-de-mystified/#1a93f9301992">Forbes</a>, "We found that if you want the largest increase in motivation and productivity," says Latham, "then big goals lead to the best outcomes. Big goals significantly outperform small goals, medium-sized goals, and vague goals."</p><p>This shows how setting big goals helps you produce big results. Setting big goals is better than setting small, medium-sized, and vague goals. You must know what you want out of life, plan your goals, and achieve them.</p><h2 id="break-up-large-tasks-into-smaller-tasks"><strong>Break Up Large Tasks Into Smaller Tasks</strong></h2><p>Let's say you're about to write a book. You're probably overwhelmed by the amount of work you'll have to put in to make this book a success. It could even take years of full-time writing until your book is good enough to be a best seller. When you have a large task that must be completed, break it up into many smaller tasks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/clean-desk-computer-plant.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><p>For example, let's say you're writing a book titled "Web Development: Everything You Need To Know". You would first break up the book into chapters.</p><p>Chapter 1: The Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, &amp; Vanilla JS)</p><p>Chapter 2: Front-End Web Development</p><p>Chapter 3: Building Applications</p><p>Chapter 4: Front-end Web Developer Tools</p><p>Chapter 5: Back-end Web Development</p><p>Then, you would only write the 1st chapter. Let's say it took you 1 week to write the 1st chapter. Once you finished the 1st, you would then take a day off to recover from your hard work, and then you would begin the 2nd chapter.</p><p>The process repeats.</p><p>The key thing in this productivity process is that instead of being overwhelmed by the large task of writing an entire book, you only focus on writing 1 chapter at a time.</p><p>This will definitely help you feel less stressed when working on big projects, resulting in being more productive during your work sessions.</p><h2 id="work-hard-play-hard"><strong>Work Hard, Play Hard</strong></h2><p>Working hard is what seems to be the #1 ingredient to success. However, what if you're working too hard? Is that even possible? Yes, it is. To be more productive, you should work hard, and play hard.</p><p>If you just finished a difficult project for a client, you should go do something that makes you feel good. This can be a walk in the park, going to the gym, or getting a chocolate chip cookie.</p><p>Whatever you do, just remember to work hard, but also reward yourself for the productive work you produced.</p><h2 id="have-a-structured-daily-routine"><strong>Have A Structured Daily Routine</strong></h2><p>Having a structured daily routine will significantly increase your productivity, and your overall success in life. I believe a structured daily routine has a morning routine, work routine, and a rest routine. Here's a handful of tips that will get you started on building an AWESOME daily routine.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/morning-routine-cup.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><h4 id="1-build-your-morning-routine"><strong>1. Build your morning routine</strong></h4><p>To have a structured daily routine, you'll need to start off by building an incredible morning routine. First, choose a time to wake up that fits well with your work schedule and gives you enough time to go through your morning routine without being in a rush.</p><p>For example, I experimented waking up at 5:00am for 1 week, and I hated it. Not only that, but there's no reason why I need to wake up that early. The same applies to you, if there isn't a reason why you should wake up at a certain time, don't wake up at that time.</p><p>If waking up at 8:00am works for your schedule, then by all means, do it. The main thing is that you set a time to wake up everyday, and do it. Personally, I experimented for a handful of years waking up at different times, but to be honest, my days are more productive when I don't have an alarm.</p><p>Of course, this is the freedom I have from working from home, but it works great for me. As of me writing this, it has been my 1st week without any alarms, and it's been GREAT.</p><h4 id="do-something-healthy-and-refreshing"><strong>Do something healthy and refreshing</strong></h4><p>Next, you'll want to do something refreshing in the morning. This can be taking a shower, or drinking tea. Pick something refreshing in the morning, and do it. Just make sure that it's not filled with sugar because if it does, expect to have a rough day full of mood swings and sugar crashes.</p><p>Drinking water is also a great and refreshing thing to do in the morning. According to a <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/5-amazing-health-benefits-of-drinking-water-in-the-morning/">study</a> by Thrive Global, there are 5 amazing health benefits of drinking water in the morning.</p><ol><li>Increased Energy Levels and a Happy Brain. Your physical performance will drop because you won't have the energy to perform regular daily activities at an optimal level. If you consume water first thing in the morning, you will ensure your brain is hydrated, and you'll increase the amount of oxygen you take in which makes you more alert and awake.</li><li>It's Great For Your Skin. When you're dehydrated, your blood thickens up and your organs pull fluid from your skin because they need water to properly operate. Drink water first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.</li><li>Water Can Treat and Prevent Headaches. Water is known to either completely treat headaches, or lower how long you have them and their pain severity.</li><li>Water Boosts Heart and Kidney Health. When you consume water first thing in the morning, you provide your kidneys with the ability to remove toxins that have built up while you were sleeping (hopefully at least 7–8 hours).</li><li>Drinking water can help kick start your metabolism on an empty stomach. Drinking water in the morning can increase the amount of calories you burn during the day, help keep you full for longer periods of time, and can remove toxins.</li></ol><h4 id="go-to-work-keep-your-environment-clean"><strong>Go to work &amp; keep your environment clean</strong></h4><p>Once you've done something refreshing to wake you up naturally, it's time to go to work. You might work at home, and that's fine. However, to be more productive, you should have a dedicated work environment free of outside distractions. This includes noises, cell phone, and television (which I'll talk more about in a minute).</p><p>You also should make sure your working (and living) environment is clean and free of dust. To ensure your work and living environment is clean, I <a href="https://www.getonedesk.com/reviews">reviewed cleaning products</a> so you can take the guesswork out of picking the best.</p><h4 id="2-build-your-work-routine"><strong>2. Build your work routine</strong></h4><p>Now that you have a solid morning routine, it's now time to build your work routine. Don't worry, it's easier than it sounds. First, you must work in chunks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/person-working-hard.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Productivity: Time & Task Management Strategies That Work"></figure><p>Imagine not taking any breaks, ever. Your mental and physical health wouldn't be close to its best, and you would feel burned out. The opposite is true when you work in chunks and take breaks often. This is also known as the Pomodoro Technique, which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.</p><p>First, choose a task you'd like to get done. It can be big, small, or something you've been not wanting to do for a long time. What matters is that the task is something that deserves your full and undivided attention.</p><p>Second, set a timer for 25 minutes, and work, work, work…until the timer is over. Then, take a short break doing something non work-related (meditate, breathe, go for a short walk).</p><p>Personally, I don't work 9–5. I work in 3–4 hour chunks of focused work where I got a LOT done. I get a lot done in the morning, evening, and late into the night. Just because this works for me doesn't mean it will work for you, but, you can give it a try.</p><h4 id="3-build-your-rest-routine"><strong>3. Build your rest routine</strong></h4><p>Last but not least, your rest routine. This part of your day is critical to having enough energy for tomorrow. You should give yourself at least 2 hours of time to rest and read books to learn new things, but NOT watch TV. This brings me to my next point.</p><h2 id="sell-or-throw-away-your-tv"><strong>Sell or throw away your TV</strong></h2><p>Did you know that in 2019, estimates suggested that U.S. adults spent an average of 3 hours and 35 minutes watching TV each day, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/186833/average-television-use-per-person-in-the-us-since-2002/">a study by statista.com</a>. Just think about that. Out of the 16–17 hours people were awake in 2019, they spent almost 22 percent of their days looking at a screen filled with time-wasting shows that filled distractions and dopamine into their brains.</p><p>This is why I don't watch TV, and will never have a TV. It is a complete waste of time, energy, and money. Out of all the things you could be doing (making money, learning, exercising, meeting people, building relationships, achieving your goals), watching TV shouldn't ever be one of them.</p><p>If you take my advice and throw away your TV or sell it, your life will significantly change for the better. You'll have much more time (3 hours 35 minutes) to achieve your goals, build relationships, learn, and make money.</p><p>This doesn't mean that you should go on Netflix on other devices. The same applies to time-wasting activities on other devices (watching movies online, tv shows on Netflix, or any other time-wasting thing you might be doing on the internet).</p><p>It might seem very difficult to not watch any TV or Netflix, but it will make a MASSIVE positive impact on your life once you do it.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>You are now a productivity expert. You learned the benefits of quitting social media, Eisenhower's time and task management tool, my simple productivity formula, why setting up and using a todo list is extremely beneficial, how having a structured daily routine is necessary for your productivity, and how not having or watching TV is a great time saver.</p><p>Now I'd like to hear from you.</p><p>What tip from this productivity guide do you want to try out first?</p><p>Are you going to focus on setting up a todo list?</p><p>Or maybe you want to make a structured daily routine?</p><p>Either way, let me know by leaving a comment, or <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_ternyak">tweeting at me</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I Taught Myself Web Development When I Was 11, Here's What I Learned]]></title><description><![CDATA[Web development is one of the most valuable skills to learn.

If you learn how to build stunning websites and applications with HTML, CSS, JS, and more, not only will you make lots of money, you will also have a valuable skillset that will enable you to build applications that people will buy and use everyday. I started teaching myself web development when I was only 11, here's everything I learned.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/web-development-roadmap.png" class="kg-image" alt="I Taught Myself Web Development When I Was 11, Here's What I Learned"></figure><h2 id="first-identify-your-goal"><strong>First, identify your goal</strong></h2><p>Before you start diving in to the tutorials, you must identify your goal. Is it to make money? Or is it to get a secure job at a company like Microsoft? Whatever it is, identify your goal and write it down so you can look at it everyday and get it engraved in your mind.</p><p>You can work as a developer at a company, work as a freelancer, create your own business, become a consultant, code for fun, or create an app to make money.</p><p>Once you identify your goal, you should move on to removing all distractions to make sure you use your valuable time wisely.</p><h2 id="get-rid-of-all-distractions"><strong>Get rid of all distractions</strong></h2><p>Distractions are everywhere. On the internet, in your house, and on your phone. It is critical that you remove these time-wasting distractions from your life, because if you don't, you probably won't end up where you wanted to be.</p><h4 id="1-delete-time-wasting-apps-on-your-cell-phone"><strong>1. Delete time-wasting apps on your cell phone</strong></h4><p>Whether it's Instagram, or that fun car racing game, whatever it is, delete time-wasting apps from your cell phone so you know you won't be spending your valuable time using them. You should also keep your cell phone off or in a separate room from where you're working.</p><p>Email is an important part of work for many people. However, it's also important that you minimize the time you spend on email to create a more focused working environment.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-spent-mobile-phone-usage-data">recent study</a>, "the overall time Americans spend on various media is expected to grow to nearly 11 hours per day this year, after accounting for declines in time spent with other media like TV and newspapers that are increasingly moving online, according to Zenith."</p><h4 id="2-create-a-clean-and-organized-work-environment"><strong>2. Create a clean and organized work environment</strong></h4><p>When you work in a messy environment, you feel messy. On the other hand, when you work in a clean and organized environment, you're more likely to be more productive. You'll also feel physically better because of the minimized dust.</p><h4 id="3-work-in-a-quiet-environment"><strong>3. Work in a quiet environment</strong></h4><p>Imagine trying to focus in a bar. The loud music and people will distract you and prevent you from being able to focus on your work. The same holds true for your work environment at home.</p><p>If you live by yourself, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you live with family or a roommate, tell them you are working and just kindly ask them to not turn on loud music or television.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/person-coding-desk.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="I Taught Myself Web Development When I Was 11, Here's What I Learned"></figure><h2 id="don-t-try-to-learn-everything-at-once"><strong>Don't try to learn everything at once</strong></h2><p>The biggest mistake I've made throughout my web development journey was to try to learn everything at once. When you try to learn everything at once, you end up learning little or even nothing.</p><p>As you're learning, don't jump from tutorial to tutorial. Have the video tutorial or blog tutorial on full screen to help minimize any possible distractions.</p><p>Set a specific amount of time that you'll learn everyday and stick to it. It's better to consistently learn 1 hour everyday than to learn 3 hours on Monday and 10 minutes on Thursday, according to <a href="https://leadaz.org/2017/03/27/consistency-yields-effective-learning/">the study</a> by leadaz.org.</p><h2 id="choose-a-platform-where-you-ll-learn-the-most"><strong>Choose a platform where you'll learn the most</strong></h2><p>Youtube is a great platform to learn web development.

The things you learn in school are not practical in the sense that you won't need to know them to succeed in the modern world.

I came home, and my brother welcomed me and said, "Congratulations! Now, you'll have so much time on your hands." I replied, "What should I do with it", and he said, "You should teach yourself how to code".</p><p>This was the most memorable moment of my life. And so that's what I did. I spent the entire summer watching youtube videos and reading articles on the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and everything in between. The first few days were exciting and exhausting.</p><p>I remember sitting on my bedroom floor for over 5 hours being extremely confused on how to get rid of default margin on the page. After finding the solution, I was the happiest web developer alive. All I had to do was <code>body { margin: 0 }</code> in the stylesheet. It was on that day that I knew I found my hidden talent and passion.</p><p>I spent the next 2 months applying my skills by building landing pages. But there was one day when I didn't feel like coding at all. I was tired of the debugging, the CSS errors, and the images not loading.</p><p>So, I did what I never thought could be possible in the world of web development. I took a BREAK. It was the most important choice I had made that taught me an important lesson. To be a successful web developer, you must take breaks. What works for me might not work for you, but I usually take a 5 minute break every 1–2 hours.</p><p>2019: After 7 months of learning the basics of web development and building landing pages, I stepped into the world of client work. Actually, I took a leap into it, and texted my friends asking them, "Hey, can you ask your dad or mom if they need or want a website". Funny enough, it worked. I ended up building a portfolio for my friend's dad that showcased his photography. At the end of that project, I learned 3 valuable lessons.</p><ol><li>Before you begin working on a project, plan everything you will need and do.</li><li>Constant client communication is critical if you want to build trust.</li><li>To prevent future headaches, know how to do what is necessary to get the job done.</li></ol><p>After this project, I decided to build my portfolio. At first, it didn't look that nice, and so I decided to use a free HTML theme to save time building it. After it was nice and filled with my projects, I focused the next two months on learning backend programming. This included the basics of python and web development with flask. It was a challenging process, but in the end, I had managed to successfully build twitter replica called "BlogItPoints". However, it taught me a lot about how the web works, and was also a fun experience.</p><p>At this point in my web developer life, I finally reached a level of satisfaction. I understood how much work I put into reaching my goal, and in fact reached that goal. I taught myself the basics of code, how to build websites, and how to find people to build them for. This is when I decided to build my own CSS framework from scratch. I planned everything I would do, and I estimated that it would take me around 2 weeks to build. It ended up taking me only two 2 days. This brings me to another lesson I've learned:</p><p>It's better to overestimate how long it will take you to complete a project and finish it earlier than expected, rather than underestimating how long it will take, and not meeting the deadline.</p><p>2020: When I came back home, I was ready to build a product that would save developers and designers hundreds of hours of time so they can focus on building web products that make the world a better place. And so that's what I did. I spent 113 long hours building <a href="http://www.loveyourlanding.com/">LoveYourLanding</a> full of blood, sweat, and tears (I got a paper cut).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/loveyourlanding.png" class="kg-image" alt="I Taught Myself Web Development When I Was 11, Here's What I Learned"></figure><p>I hope you feel inspired, motivated, and excited to make your own web development dreams come true. Becoming a self-taught web developer is hard, especially when you're young.</p><p>But, if you put in the time, effort, and thinking, then you will achieve what seems impossible, especially if you use LoveYourLanding to give you a head start. I'm 15 and taught myself how to code and be an independent web developer when I was only 13, so don't make excuses.</p><p>Share this post with anyone you know that needs a little motivation and inspiration.

There's lots of questions asking how to be successful online. But how do you come up with a valuable product?</p><h2 id="figure-out-what-problems-people-have-"><strong>Figure out what problems people have.</strong></h2><p>First, you have to figure out what problems people have. If many people have a problem, you need to figure out a profitable solution to that problem. For example, you can create a company where you're making $1M a year, but you're not actually making any money. In that situation, you need to change how much you're spending to acquire the customer.</p><h2 id="seo-brings-your-website-long-term-traffic-"><strong>SEO brings your website long-term traffic.</strong></h2><p>On top of that, you need <a href="https://backlinko.com/seo-this-year">SEO</a> because of the long-term gains and traffic it will bring to your website. The first major step to being successful online is to have a profitable product, figure out what problems people have in your niche, and make a product that solves their problem.</p><p>You will need a website that showcases your product and is professionally built. Hiring a web developer is a great option, but if you are one yourself, then taking the time to build a stunning website is worth the time and effort.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/computer-desk.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Succeeding Online When You're Young & My Experiences"></figure><h2 id="next-learn-web-development-"><strong>Next, learn web development.</strong></h2><p>The next step is to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">learn web development</a>. A common trend that many people don't notice, is that online, the people who make the most money know how to build websites for other people, and for themselves. However, what if you build a website, but you're getting little or not even any traffic. This is where promoting your website comes in.</p><h2 id="learn-how-to-promote-your-website-"><strong>Learn how to promote your website.</strong></h2><p>There are several ways of doing this, and to get you started, read and watch <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog">Neil Patel's blog</a> and <a href="https://backlinko.com/blog">Backlinko by Brian Dean</a>. Here's the gist of what they say. Step 1: Figure out what niche you're in. A great tool to use is <a href="https://www.ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a>. The guides you or your writer will write will have to be very in-depth and long.</p><p>This extra effort and work will give you more of a chance to rank in search engines for your targeted keyword(s). Include your keyword a handful of times throughout your post, and have related keywords and topics throughout the entire post. To make the structure of your articles better and easier to read, write short sentences and split up paragraphs into sections.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/loveyourlanding.png" class="kg-image" alt="Succeeding Online When You're Young & My Experiences"></figure><h2 id="make-it-clear-why-your-product-is-valuable-"><strong>Make it clear why your product is valuable.</strong></h2><p>Many people think that the next step is to sell your product. The main thing you need to do is show and explain why your product is very valuable to your potential customers. Make this very clear in the main headline. For example, if you're selling a website theme, you would say, "Build websites to grow your business in minutes".</p><p>You should tell your potential customers the main benefit of buying your product vs. telling them all of the features. Then, target your audience correctly. If you're selling a website theme, you wouldn't want to write about coconuts in your blog. On the other hand, you <em>would</em> want to write in-depth guides on how to build websites with HTML and CSS.</p><p>For example, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCuhFvV2fOY">video</a> currently ranks #1 for the keyword "succeeding online when you're young". However, I am currently working on ranking that video for other keywords as well that are searched more often.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/i-rank-first.png" class="kg-image" alt="Succeeding Online When You're Young & My Experiences"></figure><h2 id="learn-valuable-skills-when-you-re-young-"><strong>Learn valuable skills when you're young.</strong></h2><p>Next, teach yourself valuable skills when you're young, so you don't have to spend money hiring people when you're older. So, you might be thinking, why should I listen to you? Well, I started learning programming when I was 11 and am now a front-end web developer. Now, I have a serious mindset about coding, because of the benefits it can give me in the future. This is the mindset you should have in business. Take it seriously and understand your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals.</p><p>When you're building a product online, focus on SEO because it drives long-term traffic to your website. When you have consistent and long-term traffic, it's much better than getting a post viral and not getting any conversions. But, what if you're stuck in this trap where nobody finds your product, and you don't get consistent traffic.</p><h2 id="you-are-targeting-the-wrong-keywords-"><strong>You are targeting the wrong keywords.</strong></h2><p>You might be targeting the wrong keywords and you might be writing about the wrong topics. So, you must ask questions online in your niche asking potential customers what problems they have. Then, you would promote your product in the forums and write about how it would make their lives easier.</p><p>Another problem is, building a profitable online product yourself takes a long time. You might really want to build a product that's profitable, but you might not even know what to build. For example, building an HTML website theme in 2020 wouldn't actually be very useful because there are so many already made. Making a product better than your competitors is usually very challenging. The solution? Ask lots of questions online to understand what your potential customers want and need.</p><h2 id="write-valuable-content-for-free-"><strong>Write valuable content, for free.</strong></h2><p>First, write free content that will significantly benefit your potential customers. Then, once you have a blog setup and ready to go, you should <a href="https://backlinko.com/list-building">build an email list</a>. The first thing a potential customer sees is the headline. This is why the main headline of your website should have the main reason why they should buy your product. It may seem very confusing, but think about it on a basic level. If you want to be successful, you should work and strive towards financial independence.</p><p>However, being successful doesn't just mean you have money. So, you'll have to build a skill set that's very profitable. Software development is a very profitable skill to learn. If you're trying to create a software company in 2020, it's very difficult. A common problem could be that you "don't have enough time".</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://joshternyak.com/images/time-clock.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Succeeding Online When You're Young & My Experiences"></figure><h2 id="you-waste-a-lot-of-time-"><strong>You waste a lot of time.</strong></h2><p>Well, you're probably wasting it. According to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-spent-mobile-phone-usage-data">a recent study</a>, "the overall time Americans spend on various media is expected to grow to nearly 11 hours per day this year, after accounting for declines in time spent with other media like TV and newspapers that are increasingly moving online, according to Zenith."</p><p>Going through high school hating it and knowing that what I'm learning isn't valuable and won't make me any money, I was very stressed out. That's the main reason why I am so motivated to get rich by building online businesses that add lots of value to people's lives.</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to work hard to impress people. This is because you're not being real with yourself. Is your main motivation to impress people? In reality, people who try to impress aren't impressive; people who are impressive impress. The only thing you should be doing is to get better everyday and have fun while you're doing it. It's the process of consistently learning a skill set that's the most important part.</p><h2 id="use-your-first-project-as-a-learning-experience-"><strong>Use your first project as a learning experience.</strong></h2><p>The thing is, my first project was valuable not because of what I got paid, but because of how much I learned throughout the experience. The best advice I can give to anyone who’s a beginner web developer is to use your first project as a learning experience, not a “getting paid” experience.</p><p>Your end goal shouldn't be to get rich, it should be to add lots of value to people and their lives. If you can teach yourself valuable skills, people will pay you for that value you're giving them. However, exchanging time for your money can also be an issue if you're trying to make passive income.</p><p>The next step to becoming rich when you're young is to not waste time and get rid of distractions (social media, silly videos, television, and pointless reading). You have to create products and learn skills.</p><h2 id="if-you-don-t-learn-profitable-skills-you-ll-probably-end-up-working-at-a-job-you-hate-"><strong>If you don't learn profitable skills, you'll probably end up working at a job you hate.</strong></h2><p>I used to work at a movie theater, and I saw older men and women working there. At the time, I didn't realize how crazy that was. The main reason why they were in that job is because they don't have valuable skills. What's the actual purpose of someone working hard to get rich?</p><p>Why would someone spend thousands of hours learning a skill if they're just going to buy a fancy car and waste their money and live in toxic materialism and toxic lifestyles? This is a huge problem in the "celebrity" lifestyle.</p><h2 id="the-celebrity-lifestyle-isn-t-fulfilling-"><strong>The celebrity lifestyle isn't fulfilling.</strong></h2><p>Yes, celebrities might be making millions of dollars left and right, but most of them are not very fulfilled in their life. This is mainly because of the toxic culture of social media and comparing yourself to others.</p><p>In fact, millions of people are celebrities whether they realize it or not. Living your life based on how many followers you have is not a fulfilling lifestyle. In fact, are you really "living" at that point?</p><p>Truly living and experiencing life does not call for comparing yourself to others with less or more social media "followers", whatever that means.</p><p>In general, it's critical to stay sane and humble. This is especially true when you're building an online business, because if you don't, your business, the internet, and your ego will take over your life.</p><p>Many people get trapped in the cycle of working hard to get money to impress people. You must have a supportive community. During this pandemic, visiting your friends isn't an option. However, having supportive and honest friends will motivate you to continue to keep working hard because you'll actually have a reason to work hard and make money.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/9sEmlm8kV4PSM/source.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Succeeding Online When You're Young & My Experiences"></figure><h2 id="building-a-profitable-online-business-is-easy-and-hard-"><strong>Building a profitable online business is easy and hard.</strong></h2><p>In my opinion, building a profitable online business is easy and hard. Building a great product is very difficult. However, there are countless resources online that can teach you how to build it. If people are in a controlled environment with access to the internet, books, and time (most teenagers do), they should be financially independent in 5 years. Time + resources + internet = you must be rich in a handful of years.</p><p>A great and profitable skill set to have is content marketing, SEO, and web development. Knowing HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vue, Node, Python, Python Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails means you can offer people your services that you will get paid lots of money for. If you enjoy math and solving complex problems, teaching yourself computer science online is a great choice.</p><p>Amazon is a very valuable product because it helps other people find products. This is why everybody who's young and wants to succeed online has to learn software development. Before you learn web development, identify what you actually want to achieve in the long run. You should be able to know how to build web apps that solve people's problems.</p><p>We can agree that many people want to be rich. Since many people, especially milenials, have a soft mindset, if you're a hard worker that knows what you want and how to get there, you'll probably succeed. Many people are trained to be soft because of their parents spoiling them and because of the way society treats them. Removing addiction to buying "things" because it gets rid of dopamine in your life and allows you to focus on what's important.</p><h2 id="access-to-the-internet-means-you-have-access-to-becoming-wealthy-"><strong>Access to the internet means you have access to becoming wealthy.</strong></h2><p>To wrap things up, if you have access to the internet, and live in a civil environment, you shouldn't have any excuses of why you're not rich in the next 5 years. You should spend time everyday learning valuable skills that you will get paid lots of money for in the near future.</p><p>You must have a valuable skill set to achieve financial independence. Learning web development, software development, SEO, and/or content marketing. Writing is also a profitable skill. However, it's best that you learn programming and how to write quality content that attracts potential customers.</p><p>Learning SEO will help you get long-term traffic to your website that you built with your coding skills. You must not waste time and create opportunities for you and your business. To be rich, you must add value to people's lives.</p><p>In the next episode, we will talk about is why having a support system is important and why living in a community and not living in a fancy mansion by yourself will help you stay sane. My main goal with this podcast is to help people who want to succeed online do so in a way that keeps them sane and without lots of stress and panic.</p><p>If you're looking for daily tips, stories, and resources to help you grow your business and enjoy the process along the way, join the newsletter, it's free.</p><p>Now I'd like to hear from you.</p><p>What tip from this online business guide do you want to try out first?</p><p>Are you going to focus on learning profitable skills?</p><p>Or maybe you want to use your first project as a learning experience?</p><p>Either way, let me know by leaving a comment, or <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_ternyak">tweeting at me</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
