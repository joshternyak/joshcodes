If you learn how to build stunning websites and applications with HTML, CSS, JS, and more, not only will you make lots of money, you will also have a valuable skillset that will enable you to build applications that people will buy and use everyday. I started teaching myself web development when I was only 11, here's everything I learned.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"></figure><h2 id="first-identify-your-goal"><strong>First, identify your goal</strong></h2><p>Before you start diving in to the tutorials, you must identify your goal. Is it to make money? Or is it to get a secure job at a company like Microsoft? Whatever it is, identify your goal and write it down so you can look at it everyday and get it engraved in your mind.</p><p>You can work as a developer at a company, work as a freelancer, create your own business, become a consultant, code for fun, or create an app to make money.</p><p>Once you identify your goal, you should move on to removing all distractions to make sure you use your valuable time wisely.</p><h2 id="get-rid-of-all-distractions"><strong>Get rid of all distractions</strong></h2><p>Distractions are everywhere. On the internet, in your house, and on your phone. It is critical that you remove these time-wasting distractions from your life, because if you don't, you probably won't end up where you wanted to be.</p><h4 id="1-delete-time-wasting-apps-on-your-cell-phone"><strong>1. Delete time-wasting apps on your cell phone</strong></h4><p>Whether it's Instagram, or that fun car racing game, whatever it is, delete time-wasting apps from your cell phone so you know you won't be spending your valuable time using them. You should also keep your cell phone off or in a separate room from where you're working.</p><p>Email is an important part of work for many people. However, it's also important that you minimize the time you spend on email to create a more focused working environment.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-spent-mobile-phone-usage-data">recent study</a>, "the overall time Americans spend on various media is expected to grow to nearly 11 hours per day this year, after accounting for declines in time spent with other media like TV and newspapers that are increasingly moving online, according to Zenith."</p><h4 id="2-create-a-clean-and-organized-work-environment"><strong>2. Create a clean and organized work environment</strong></h4><p>When you work in a messy environment, you feel messy. On the other hand, when you work in a clean and organized environment, you're more likely to be more productive. You'll also feel physically better because of the minimized dust.</p><h4 id="3-work-in-a-quiet-environment"><strong>3. Work in a quiet environment</strong></h4><p>Imagine trying to focus in a bar. The loud music and people will distract you and prevent you from being able to focus on your work. The same holds true for your work environment at home.</p><p>If you live by yourself, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you live with family or a roommate, tell them you are working and just kindly ask them to not turn on loud music or television.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"></figure><h2 id="don-t-try-to-learn-everything-at-once"><strong>Don't try to learn everything at once</strong></h2><p>The biggest mistake I've made throughout my web development journey was to try to learn everything at once. When you try to learn everything at once, you end up learning little or even nothing.</p><p>As you're learning, don't jump from tutorial to tutorial. Have the video tutorial or blog tutorial on full screen to help minimize any possible distractions.</p><p>Set a specific amount of time that you'll learn everyday and stick to it. It's better to consistently learn 1 hour everyday than to learn 3 hours on Monday and 10 minutes on Thursday, according to <a href="https://leadaz.org/2017/03/27/consistency-yields-effective-learning/">the study</a> by leadaz.org.</p><h2 id="choose-a-platform-where-you-ll-learn-the-most"><strong>Choose a platform where you'll learn the most</strong></h2><p>Youtube is a great platform to learn web development.

There are many people who didn't like school and didn't do well that succeeded in web development. The things you learn in school are not practical in the sense that you won't need to know them to succeed in the modern world. Knowing what Romeo did in Act 1, Scene 2 in Romeo &amp; Juliet is pointless and won't add any value to your life, so don't even break a sweat worrying about it.</p><h2 id="web-development-is-very-profitable"><strong>Web development is very profitable</strong></h2><p>However, teaching yourself web development will add lots of value to your life and people who you will work with. It is a very profitable industry full of competitive salaries.</p><p>I'm not a finance expert, but I do know that a common financial mistake humans make is once they get a high-paying job, they tend to spend more money. Whether it's buying a new car, or buying a fancier house, they don't realize the long-term effects of living over their means.</p><p>This is why you must not spend money on things that won't actually add value to your life.

I came home, and my brother welcomed me and said, "Congratulations! Now, you'll have so much time on your hands." I replied, "What should I do with it", and he said, "You should teach yourself how to code".</p><p>This was the most memorable moment of my life. And so that's what I did. I spent the entire summer watching youtube videos and reading articles on the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and everything in between. The first few days were exciting and exhausting.</p><p>I remember sitting on my bedroom floor for over 5 hours being extremely confused on how to get rid of default margin on the page. After finding the solution, I was the happiest web developer alive. All I had to do was <code>body { margin: 0 }</code> in the stylesheet. It was on that day that I knew I found my hidden talent and passion.</p><p>I spent the next 2 months applying my skills by building landing pages. But there was one day when I didn't feel like coding at all. I was tired of the debugging, the CSS errors, and the images not loading.</p><p>So, I did what I never thought could be possible in the world of web development. I took a BREAK. It was the most important choice I had made that taught me an important lesson. To be a successful web developer, you must take breaks. What works for me might not work for you, but I usually take a 5 minute break every 1â€“2 hours.</p><p>2019: After 7 months of learning the basics of web development and building landing pages, I stepped into the world of client work. Actually, I took a leap into it, and texted my friends asking them, "Hey, can you ask your dad or mom if they need or want a website". Funny enough, it worked. I ended up building a portfolio for my friend's dad that showcased his photography. At the end of that project, I learned 3 valuable lessons.</p><ol><li>Before you begin working on a project, plan everything you will need and do.</li><li>Constant client communication is critical if you want to build trust.</li><li>To prevent future headaches, know how to do what is necessary to get the job done.</li></ol><p>After this project, I decided to build my portfolio. At first, it didn't look that nice, and so I decided to use a free HTML theme to save time building it. After it was nice and filled with my projects, I focused the next two months on learning backend programming. This included the basics of python and web development with flask. It was a challenging process, but in the end, I had managed to successfully build twitter replica called "BlogItPoints". However, it taught me a lot about how the web works, and was also a fun experience.</p><p>At this point in my web developer life, I finally reached a level of satisfaction. I understood how much work I put into reaching my goal, and in fact reached that goal. I taught myself the basics of code, how to build websites, and how to find people to build them for. This is when I decided to build my own CSS framework from scratch. I planned everything I would do, and I estimated that it would take me around 2 weeks to build. It ended up taking me only two 2 days. This brings me to another lesson I've learned:</p><blockquote>It's better to overestimate how long it will take you to complete a project and finish it earlier than expected, rather than underestimating how long it will take, and not meeting the deadline.</blockquote><p>2020: When I came back home, I was ready to build a product that would save developers and designers hundreds of hours of time so they can focus on building web products that make the world a better place. And so that's what I did. I spent 113 long hours building <a href="http://www.loveyourlanding.com/">LoveYourLanding</a> full of blood, sweat, and tears (I got a paper cut).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"></figure><p>I hope you feel inspired, motivated, and excited to make your own web development dreams come true. Becoming a self-taught web developer is hard, especially when you're young.</p><p>But, if you put in the time, effort, and thinking, then you will achieve what seems impossible, especially if you use LoveYourLanding to give you a head start. I'm 15 and taught myself how to code and be an independent web developer when I was only 13, so don't make excuses.</p><p>Share this post with anyone you know that needs a little motivation and inspiration. My goal is to help and inspire as much people as I possibly can and to make the world of web development a more fun, exciting, and better place.</p><p>Now I'd like to hear from you.</p><p>What tip from this web development guide do you want to try out first?</p><p>Are you going to focus on learning HTML &amp; CSS?</p><p>Or maybe you want to get started by learning back-end programming languages?</p><p>Either way, let me know by leaving a comment, or <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_ternyak">tweeting at me</a>.</p>
